# Customer-Segmentation-using-ML


ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This project performs customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques. It leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and KMeans Clustering to identify meaningful customer groups based on demographic, behavioral, and purchasing data.

The dataset used is derived from a marketing campaign database, and the objective is to categorize customers into distinct clusters to help businesses better understand and target their audience.


ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives
Understand and preprocess customer demographic and transactional data.

Perform feature engineering (Age, Tenure, Total Spend, etc.).

Apply PCA to reduce noise and retain the most meaningful features.

Use KMeans clustering to segment customers into interpretable clusters.

Visualize the clusters and extract key insights from each customer group. 



ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights
After training the KMeans model and reducing dimensions using PCA:

The model identified distinct customer clusters based on age, income, purchase behavior, and customer tenure.

Each cluster reflects unique customer traits (e.g., high-spending loyal customers, low-engagement new customers, etc.).

Visualizations using PCA plots and cluster heatmaps help interpret each segment clearly.

ðŸ’¡ These insights can help marketing teams with:

Personalized marketing strategies

Customer retention efforts

Loyalty program targeting

Product recommendations
